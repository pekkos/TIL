# :lang pseudo class

Use the :lang pseudo-class to add styling based on language.

The :lang pseudo-class is used to select an element based on its content language. The content language of an element is determined by a combination of three things:

- Any lang attributes
- Meta tags, e.g. <meta http-equiv="content-language" content="en">
- HTTP headers, e.g. Content-language: en

This means that the :lang pseudo-class can be used even in cases where no lang attribute is specified.
Block formatting context may be created by using display: flow-root;
