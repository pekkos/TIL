Setting up SourceTree to work with Azure DevOps is a real PITA, so here are my notes after searching and searching:

1. Create PAT at DevOps
2. Copy PAT, keep it safe
3. Clear the SourceTree cache at `/Users/rlew/Library/Application Support/SourceTree` 
4. Set up an account using `https://orgname.visualstudio.com` as host
5. Use email address as username
6. Use PAT as password
7. Select https
