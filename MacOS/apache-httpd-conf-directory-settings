/var/log/apache2 should exist on macOS as it comes with its own Apache server. If it does not you could try to create it yourself again by doing:

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/log/apache2 && sudo chown root:wheel /var/log/apache2
```

# Apache httpd.conf directory settings

If you run into access problems in Apache, getting a message like ```You don't have permission to access this resource.```,
try changing the directory settings in http.conf

I ran into this problem after updating to MacOS Catalina.


```bash
<Directory />
    #Options FollowSymLinks
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
    AllowOverride All
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
</Directory>
```
