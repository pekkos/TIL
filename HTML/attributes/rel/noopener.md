# rel=noopener

If you have links to another origin, you should use rel="noopener", especially if they open in a new tab/window. [Explained by Jake Archibald here](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/performance-benefits-of-rel-noopener/).

```
<a href="http://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
   Example site
</a>
